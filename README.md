#whirling-rain

A Windows screen saver. 

##### Note
This an old program I wrote many years ago which is hosted on [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net). The code might have been lost somewhere in the wild without [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net). So I want to say: Thank you [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net)!
